# Hello MonoGame

Did you know MonoGame is the engine behind Stardew Valley and Celeste? And it's in C#, everyone's favorite language?

I've got to give this a try!

## Setup

1. Install git and VS Code
1. Install Git LFS
1. Install the recommended extensions, especially C# Dev Kit
1. Open Game1.cs
1. Click "Run" in the top right menu, or press F5 to run :)

A blue window named `hello-monogame` should open! It's not resizable and nothing else happens, but it's a window!
